# cert-validator

## Startup

1. Pull down files

2. Follow instructions inside `daisychain.sh` 

3. Use `sh cleanup.sh` to cleanup directory after verifying the cert chain.



## Helpful Info

1. The `openssl.cnf` file inside this repo is the default `.cnf` for a Root CA
2. Inside the instructions for `daisychain.sh` there will be a few more `.cnf` files which will need to be made in the Intermediate folder and their changes are reflected in the commends of `daisychain.sh`
